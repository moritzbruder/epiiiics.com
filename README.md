# epiiics.com

Epiiics is a small web-app that allowsusers to quickly define product epics. The user can create their page by adding components that show text, images, links or goals.
It's available at [epiiics.com](https://epiiics.com) and built using Angular as well as Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage Buckets for file storage. 

The entire project was designed, built and released over a weekend as part of a personal challenge.
